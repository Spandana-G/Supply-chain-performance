# Week-1
Sustainable supply chain performance focuses on balancing economic, environmental, and social goals. It involves reducing waste, emissions, and energy use, ensuring fair labor practices, and sourcing responsibly. The aim is to create an efficient, resilient supply chain that promotes long-term success while minimizing environmental impact.
# Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard
This project presents a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into supply chain performance with a focus on sustainability, costs, production, and transportation efficiency. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to help organizations optimize logistics, reduce waste, and improve decision-making.
# Objectives of the Project
1.Optimize Logistics – Reduce shipping costs, improve route planning, and enhance transportation efficiency.                  
2.Improve Production – Monitor supplier performance and streamline manufacturing lead times.                                    
3.Enhance Sales & Inventory – Track product sales, stock levels, and revenue trends.                                         
4.Ensure Quality – Reduce defect rates and improve inspection processes.                                            
5.Enable Data-Driven Decisions – Provide interactive insights for better supply chain management.

# Process  
1️.Gather, clean, and structure supply chain data.                                                           
2.Create relationships, measures, and calculations for insights.                                            
3.Build interactive visuals (charts, maps, slicers) for analysis.                                                       
4. Ensure smooth performance and validate data accuracy.                                                  
5.Publish, automate refresh, and plan improvements.
