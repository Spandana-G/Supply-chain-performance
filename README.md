Sustainable supply chain performance focuses on balancing economic, environmental, and social goals. It involves reducing waste, emissions, and energy use, ensuring fair labor practices, and sourcing responsibly. The aim is to create an efficient, resilient supply chain that promotes long-term success while minimizing environmental impact.
#Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard
This project presents a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into supply chain performance with a focus on sustainability, costs, production, and transportation efficiency. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to help organizations optimize logistics, reduce waste, and improve decision-making.
